# (Just kidding, run your tests in CI/CD like a responsible adult)

# These JVM flags are like performance vitamins for your container:
# - MaxRAMPercentage: Don't be greedy, use 75% max
# - InitialRAMPercentage: Start with 50% like a reasonable person
# - MaxMetaspaceSize: Uncontrollable growing is cancer, in form of a deadly OutOfMemoryError
# - UseG1GC: Because G1 is the cool garbage collector, fine tune it for your actual usage
#
# Add other parameters to tailor to your project's needs
